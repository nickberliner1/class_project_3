# class_project_3
Website prototype built using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Javascript


This was created for a university project where we had to build a website prototype for a "client" before fully building the site out. Any images, code, names, descriptions, or links used that are not mine are not intended for business or copyright purposes, just trying to get a good grade.

After cloning the repo, make sure to install jQuery as well.
